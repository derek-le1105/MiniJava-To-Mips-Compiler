First run the J2V.java with the 'javac J2V.java'
The J2V is similar to the Typecheck.java from phase1

It goes to the pass1 which just goes through the whole passed program.
Then it just grabs the class then its respective objects and methods and its all done
under the pass1.java.

There it gets the holder function and we just use that as a way to save stuff. Tho, I have not 
set up the extends and such. Also theres a problem with the order its printing and doesn't 
follow the expected output. Might need to check on that. If you check the holder program in the maps
the comments below it shows what I put in them. So as you can see it doesn't handle the superclass yet.

Now after the whole program passed to the J2V has been finished we pass the holder class, the one under 
the pass1 to the printer.java.

In printer.java it just grabs the hashmap from hold and create a print or return a string. 

That's mainly it. 

TLDR: J2V -> pass1 (with holder) -> printer
